# Challenge
### JavaScript, Node, Express

This was an exercise from the Rocketseat GoStack's course, 
and the main goal was to implement REST API requests, using the technologies above, 
to list, create, update and delete an object "repo", that was like a single repository,
in the const "repositories", that was simulating a database.
